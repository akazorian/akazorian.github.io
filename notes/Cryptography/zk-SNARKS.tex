\section{Introduction}
Whether or not we are in a cryptocurrency bubble is not what drives the discussion of zk-SNARKs. Yes, zcash is the currency that introduced many people to the topic of this write up; however, the effect of zk-SNARKs could be wider reaching than a cryptocurrency. \\
This article will be broken up into three parts, each meant to explain the topic to a seperate audience. These audiences are: the average adult, an undergraduate focusing on computer science or math, and a graduate student interested in cryptography or some complexity theoritic topic or another. For all three audiences, it will be benefitial to know what zk-SNARK is an acronym of. Yeah it's a catchy thing to say, but it is quite descriptive of an acronym. A zk-SNARK is a zero-knowledge, Succinct, Non-interactive, ARgument of Knowledge and that really is a mouthfull.

\section{Motivation}
When trying to understand a cryptographic primitive it always helps to understand why it exists. In other words, what problem does it solve? In doing so, we will have the necessary motivation to drive future research and curiosity! Let's get to it by first introducing our main characters Alice and Bob. Picture this: our protaganists reside in a dystopian society in the near future where government surveillance runs rampant. Alice and Bob are attempting to orchestrate a rebellion right under the nose of the black suits in office. They have found a hide out to base their operation from, but need a method of quickly proving that a member knows the secret word for getting in

\section{ELI5: A Primer for the Average Person}
This primer will also introduce the motivation behind zk-SNARKs and so let us begin with a real life application. I know
